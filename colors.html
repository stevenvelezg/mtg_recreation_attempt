    <h1>Below is a brief explination of the colors of Magic! With this information, hopefully you can find a playstyle that fits you.</h1>
    <div class="white">
      <h2>White</h2>
      <p>White is a color that enjoys playing things with a small mana cost in order to amas an army. It plays smaller, weaker creatures while using enchantments, artifacts, instants and sorceries in order to buff them up to be stronger and more useful. At the same time, it is very big on pure fighting and healing up while being somewhat tactical. This is a good color for most beginners and is seen as a fun and balanced color.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="green">
      <h2>Green</h2>
      <p>Like white, this is a color that likes to heal but is also big on slowing things down a bit (unlike white) until it can put out very large threats. Most cards are higher up in mana costs to play but in return have large damage and health numbers in order to threaten the opponent and put them on a clock. Due to the high mana costs, it likes to mana fix a lot (find and play extra mana) in order to balance out. This is a moderate level color that is good for beginners, though can be somewhat tricky; this is also seen as fun and somewhat balanced.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="red">
      <h2>Red</h2>
      <p>Red is a class all of it's own. If white and green are nice, fancy cars, red is a Formula 1 race car. Red likes to play fast and hard, burning down it's opponents health with low cost spells to hurt the opposing board state, creatures with haste, and burn spells(small damage spells that can hit the opponent directly). This color loves to have it's draw backs though, so it is always good to be careful with what you do. This is a color that is good for beginners and is incredibly fun when it can burn things fast and hard, while being seen as well balanced.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="black">
      <h2>Black</h2>
      <p>Black, like red, is in a field all it's own. Black loves to hurt itself to hurt another. Black plays in a way where it will chop it's own arm off if it means you'll hurt even more. The color revolves around sacrificing your own creatures, discarding cards from your hand, and paying for spells with your own health in order to hurt your opponent. While an incredibly fun and balanced color, it is not recommended for beginners (this doesn't mean you shouldn't play it, as you need to learn somehow!).</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="blue">
      <h2>Blue</h2>
      <p>Now we move into one of the most hated colors in all of the game, blue. Blue is the color that remembers that this is a game and thus loves to fuck with everyone and everything. The color revolves around heavy control, meaning having lots of counterspells, card draw, and scry in order to best set itself up for victory while denying its opponent a lot of its board and spells. This is a color that is regarded as tons of fun (for the player, not the opponent) and is seen as a color you play if you want to be an ass. Play this color, it's too much fun not to.</p>
