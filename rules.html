    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <h2>Um... Ask about them because there's a lot..... But basic rules are:
      <ul>
        <li>Only play 1 land per turn</li>
        <li>Everything but land is a spell, which means everything but lands can be countered</li>
        <li>Instants, ablities, and things with flash can be played at any time, everything else is during your main phases only</li>
      </ul>
      Um... yeah. Anything else, just ask about it.</h1>
